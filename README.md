## Installation
You can install the connector via Composer using the following command:

```bash
composer require topsoft4u/api-connector
```

## Usage

Each method has its own example in the [examples](example) directory.

For explanation of each method, please refer to the API documentation links mentioned earlier.

## Functions
- Type-safe methods and responses with null-type support.
- Client (connector) validations before sending requests.
- Error handling with exceptions.
- Option to change output language.
- Option to change the output format (JSON/XML).
- You can fetch the JSON/XML file without parsing (usable for testing).
- Test mode for POST methods (sends data to the server, but it's not saved).

## Releasing a new version
1. Update the version in the `composer.json` file with `bash /scripts/bump_version.sh`.
2. Finish the release with `bash /scripts/commit_tag_push.sh` - which will create a new tag and push it to the repository.
